<p>This paragraph will wrap around the image. The image is floated to the left, and the text will fill the space around it. When the image is floated, the surrounding text flows naturally alongside it, creating a wrapped effect. You can see that even with a longer paragraph, the text continues to fill the available space beside the image, giving a more structured layout to the content. This technique has been traditionally used to embed images within articles, news posts, or blog entries, where text and images coexist within a single frame.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph that will continue below the image. Once the space beside the image is exhausted, the following paragraphs will behave normally, without wrapping around the image. Using float for layout purposes can be useful, but with the introduction of modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, there are now more flexible ways to design layouts.</p>
